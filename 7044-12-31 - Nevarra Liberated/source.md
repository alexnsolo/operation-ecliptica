### *Nevarra Liberated as the Drowned Court Collapses in Coordinated Uprising*

**NEVARRA, THALASSOR** — What began as an unprecedented planetary lockdown has ended in the total collapse of one of the galaxy’s most infamous criminal syndicates. Following weeks of unrest and a sudden, highly coordinated uprising, the floating city of **Nevarra** has been declared *liberated*, and the criminal organization known as the **Drowned Court** has been dismantled.

Imperial officials confirmed today that **Governor Benjamin Grey**, long-serving ruler of Thalassor, was taken into custody shortly after the fall of the Court’s central compound. Grey will stand trial before an Imperial tribunal on charges of corruption, conspiracy, and willful collaboration with organized crime.

### **The Fall of the Leviathan**

At the center of the collapse was the death of **Vorn Kaskel**, widely known as *the Leviathan King*. Once believed untouchable, Kaskel was killed during the final hours of the uprising when resistance forces struck deep beneath Nevarra’s central platform.

Imperial intelligence has declined to release operational details, citing ongoing investigations, but senior analysts confirmed that the engagement marked “the irreversible end of the Drowned Court’s command structure.”

### **A Voice from the Docks**

Emerging as the public face of the rebellion is **Marrow Quell**, a former dockworker turned resistance organizer whose name has become synonymous with the uprising. Speaking to crowds gathered along the Coil Docks, Quell announced her intention to run for governor in the forthcoming emergency election.

In a moment already echoing across off-world labor channels, Quell publicly invoked a phrase long forbidden under Court rule:

> *“The Inferno of Justice Starts with a Spark.”*

Witnesses describe the crowd’s reaction as immediate and overwhelming.

Quell went on to thank the off-world operatives who aided the resistance, referring to them only as *“the angels of justice,”* crediting their actions as instrumental in the overthrow of Kaskel and the destruction of the Court.

### **Imperial Response**

**Emperor Sophia** issued a formal statement hours after Nevarra’s liberation:

> *“The Drowned Court was a horrendous criminal organization that thrived on suffering, exploitation, and decay. Its destruction was not only inevitable — it was deserved. I thank the agents of the Empire who have worked tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice.”*

Imperial authorities confirmed that Nevarra will remain under provisional oversight until local elections can be held, though governance is expected to return to civilian leadership once stability is assured.

### **Shadows and Silence**

Multiple inside sources reported detailed descriptions of the off-world individuals involved in the uprising, as well as their distinctive starship. Within hours, however, those records were reclassified under the highest Imperial security protocols.

When questioned, a spokesperson for Imperial Internal Affairs offered only the following:

> *“Certain participants in this operation are protected under extraordinary classification. Their identities will not be disclosed.”*

As Nevarra begins the long work of rebuilding amid storm and steel, one truth is already clear: the city’s future was not granted from above — it was taken, spark by spark, from below.
